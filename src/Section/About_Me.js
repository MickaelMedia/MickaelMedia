                <p>Thanks for looking at this website. I don't know how much of your time I wasted, all I wish is that you had fun navigating the website xD</p>
                <p>I am a guy who just really wants to spend his time doing 3 things. Discussing or working in health care; going out for a really epic ride one my mountian bike and finally coding new or just fun stuff.</p>
                <p>I choose to get into Health because of the different possibilities as a bed-side nurse, assistant, teacher, chief nurse and etc.... But, I still have fun learning how to code better and also how to ride my bike with STEEEEEEEEEEZE xD</p>
                <p>If you want to contact me to give me suggestions for my website or to talk about something cool in nursing or MTB hit me up</p>
