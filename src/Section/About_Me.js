                <p>Thanks for looking at this website. I don't know how much of your time I wasted, all I wish is that you had fun navigating the website xD</p>
                <p>I am a guy who just really wants to spend his time doing 3 things. Discussing or working in health care; going out for a really epic ride one my mountian bike and finally coding new or just fun stuff.</p>
                <p>I choose to get into Health because of the different possibilities as a bed-side nurse, assistant, teacher, chief nurse and etc.... But, I still have fun learning how to code better and also how to ride my bike with STEEEEEEEEEEZE xD</p>
                <p>If you want to contact me to give me suggestions for my website or to talk about something cool in nursing or MTB hit me up</p>

                <p>2021-08-09: I swear I am still working on this, Just I cant seem to fix a few of my bugs. (Imagine me screeching at the screen because of bugs and display problems, I feel like a caveman rn).</p>

                <p>2021-06-09: So I just added a translator switch in my article section. I am only going to keep it in that section because I don't want to translate my whole website, I am only going to keep it in there.</p>
                <p>2021-06-03: Added may 2021 section in the blog, just realized that using HashRouter has killed my sections in the biking part, going to doublecheck that</p>
