                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p><b>So How was 2020 for Me?</b></p>
                <p>I am not gonna lie, 2020 Was a hell of a year</p>
                <p><b>Let's start with the good.</b></p>
                <p> 2020 represented a year where I could bounce back from my worst defeat yet and focus on what I really like. I got into Mountain biking, fitness, coding and nursing (again). When I say I really got into mountain biking; What I mean is I started racing, looking at details like geometry and specs on a bike to have an idea of the feel. Racing was a cool experience even though I did finish last on 2 races, but 4th Overall. Fitness kinda came with mountain biking. I went to the gym to push my body so I could pedal harder out of turns. Coding was a first for me but here we are xD. I am making my own website, publishing my projects and ideas on my own platform and contributing to open GitHubs. Nursing, Last year I failed hard, Never even had the guts to tell to my parents. But here I am not giving up and going at it again. The reason why is because in my mind I can only lose if I give up. Fortunetaly for me, my dad didn't raise a quitter. So here I am back again, getting up and getting ready to give everything I like another shot.</p>
                <p><b>The bad.</b></p>
                <p>This year I HAD SO MUCH ANXIETY. The problem with me is that I don't want to externalise my problems because to an extent my family relates with me and usually suffers with me. I am stoic because at the end it causes my familly less pain and in turn less for me. I kinda forced myself to move out and I am discovering really for the first time why making a certain amount of money is important. I am contempt with my lliving situation but I know for a fact if I did one month extra I would lose my shit. Don't get me wrong the guys are really cool, but they are idiots who don't understand the concept of maintenance and moderation. To be fair I didn't before but I am slowly growing up and I want all this pain to be a catalyst for my adulthood.</p>
