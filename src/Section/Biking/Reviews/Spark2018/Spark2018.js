            <p>The 2018 Scott Spark is a trail/XC bike that is intended for people who love climbing more than descending. That does not mean that the bike is a slow descender in its category.</p>

            <h3 id="Spec">Specs</h3>
            <p>I have the 950 Scott Spark. Its the cheapest of the bung at 2600CAD. Its outfitted with a 32 fox, Deore drivetrain and syncros externals.  I think for the price its really well kited, but I think that the stem is a bit too long for me. I really like descending, so a shorter stem allowed me to be able to get more behind my bike and not suffer from the old OTB treatment. As per Scott bikes, This bicycle is outfitted with a synchro’s lock-out on the handlebar that allows it to lock out the fork and the shock to reduce pedal bob and augment pedal efficiency. I tried the system a few times and realized that If you want it to keep working properly you have to check it every month of riding. One crash is enough to move the lockout spring in the fork and make the system ineffective. On top of that I am really a fan of simple cables, simple cockpit. The lockout adds a lot to the already jammed cockpit. </p>

            <h3 id="Climbing">Climbing</h3>
            <p>I do not like lying so I will be honest. This bike climbs really well even after switching the stem. Before switching the stem I didn’t really have to lean forward for those really steep climbs. I don have to admit that techy climbs on rocks were a bit hard with the stem at 55m. Now with the shorter stem, I have to lean forward for those really steep climbs but I don`t mind. The stock tires are pretty good and light, but I do have to admit that you can change them for more aggressive tires. When you really need to put the power down they slip until you adjust your body position. The tires work, but I think they if you want to change something first change the tires for a more aggressive pattern.</p>

            <h3 id="Descending">Descending</h3>
            <p>I got a few problems with how this bike came stock for descents. You can descend with this bike, but its never going to be a priority until you change a few specs in this bike. The longer stem makes this bike feel slightly twitchy when you go super fast. Only problem is, you accelerate super fast with this bike which is why it was a bit uncomfortable. Its snappy so you can always just jump everything and surprisingly land well. The bike has a good suspension platform. I put a bit more PSI because I love jumping and just going Barreli gas when I can. For a 120mm rear suspension, this bike can handle more then your average XC bike can. Hell man If It was on me I’d call it down country but, the rest of the package seems to hold it back. </p>

            <p>Overall the scott Spark is a really good bike for people who only do XC and what a bit more plush from their XC bikes. </p>
