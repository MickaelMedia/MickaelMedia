            <h3>Presentation</h3>
            <p>The 2019 HighTower from Santa Cruz is an all mountain bike. Supported with 140mm of rear travel and 150mm of front travel the bikes objectifs is to be ridden anywhere. Soft packed trails, Check; Hard rowdy trails, Check. The HighTower Boast 67° HTA, 435mm chainstay and a seat tube of 74.3°. These numbers are reasonable and should allow you to ride the bike park and the sketchy trails in your neighborhood</p>

            <h3>Specs</h3>
            <p>its been to long lmao</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Climbing</h3>
            <p>So, I am pretty sure you are asking yourself how a Santa Cruz Hightower with 150mm front travel and 140mm of rear travel climbs. To be honest, a lot better than I expected. The front of the fork has a lockout for when you must climb all the way up the mountain. The position and linkage of the rear shock restrict the amount of pedal bob that you must endure to get up the mountain. Like really, The VPP suspension design link allows the bike to be very progressive and keep you at a sweet spot of that curve. When you are going up you do not really apply a lot of pressure, so the rear shock only needs to adjust to small bumps, and it does that job well. </p>
            <p>Handling wise, the Hightower is a bike that felt a bit sluggish going up. The front of the bike was always planted on the ground even when tackling 30degree hills. My only problem during that type of climb was wrestling the front of my bike to turn and keep enough momentum to not have to dismount. But again, I barely execute that climb with my own XC/Trail bike so just barely making it with a full-on trail/enduro bike is an accomplishment. </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Descending</h3>
            <p>This section right here, is where I can start praising the bike. I have ridden a few bikes. I am starting to understand how the specs change the feel of a bike. The tricky thing about making a bike that can climb and descend is making sure that the handling is not in the extremes of sluggish or twitchy and that the bike does not feel too plush or too responsive. In my opinion, the bike feels very well. When you go fast, you start noticing small bumps less and only really noticing those big hits. For example, I would not feel the braking bumps on a berm, but I would more then likely feel a hell of compression when I tried a 6 feet drop. </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>Overall I was pretty satisfied with my demo of the bike. To be honest I would have really prefered a steeper seat tube angle. I dont think you can add a long er fork but maybe reducing the travel and slackening with head tube slacker would make wonders for this bike. But again I like too feel in the middle of my bike because I usually ride a spark 950.</p>
