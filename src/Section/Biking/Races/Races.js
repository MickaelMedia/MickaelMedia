                <p>My last race experience was in 2020 for the Wildside. It's been awhile but I still think I can offer a few tips.</p>
                <p>Tips for racing:</p>
                <b>#1 Pre-day track recon</b>
                <p>Most enduro races have a pre-race recon thats usually done 1-2 days before the race. Honestly this might be the most important thing to do. I Highly suggest you check out the tracks and search for the race lines that are faster.</p>
                <b>#2 Check your gear</b>
                <p>Depending on race condition you are going to want to change your setup. On rainier days you should decrease Psi in your tires and your shock as well as reduce rebound a bit to compensate. Always experiment with your setup before race day to dial your setting. If you don't its ok. But, the important aspect is feeling comfortable on your bike and making sure you can always maneuver without feeling awkward on your bike</p>
                <b>#3 Its okay to be anxious</b>
                <p>Especially if it's your first race you might not finish top 3 even in amateur. So don't sweat it. You gotta start somewhere and start with getting experience in the whole race setting. Your goal is to get better and being timed against better people and just hanging out with them is gonna push you to do your best. So Squash that anxiety with excitement ang just have a good time racing other people</p>
