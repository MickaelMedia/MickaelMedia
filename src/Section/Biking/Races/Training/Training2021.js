                    So, since I am still in Uni, I can get a consultation with kinesiologist for my gym workout. I met the guy with a laidback attitude, and he told me he has a lot of experience training with teams and athletes. Usually he trains football college athletes, so being a mountain biker and a swimmer kind of throws him a softball. But he told me he was going to do a bit of research and work out something for me. I told him my frequency of sports, my average wattage when I ride and that I wanted to improve my wattage. He took all that information into aspect and told me to give him 2 days to get something ready.

                    Fast forward 2 days I meet up with him and he explains his plan to me. So, the basis of my training regimen in the gym is to go for an initial effort of about 80% and sustain it with a superset to workout my endurance. It simulates the amount of effort that I put in when I start going up the mountain because, I will always have resistance when I am pedaling up the mountain.

                    First week up I have 2 supersets with one being a double set and another one being a triple set. The first exercise has resistance exercise with a front lunge or back lunge with a squat bar followed by bodyweight exercise that use my core and legs. From my perspective It looks legit, and I can very well relate to the initial push followed by keeping the rhythm. It applies very well to my downhill sections of enduro where you need to start with an aggressive acceleration and keep the rhythm until the end of the section.  His part is done now I need to do mine which is consistency and making sure I have fun during the whole training regimen.
