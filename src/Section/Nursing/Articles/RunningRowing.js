                I made plans to go the gym with a friend of mine then suddenly he told me he was going to be 15 minutes late. I decided I was going to do some cardio for the 15 minutes before bulking out on lifts as a mean to prepare myself for my training routine. So, here I am in the cardio spot of my Gym with the choice of either running, rowing or indoor biking. Then my question arose, which one is the best for me?

                Luckily for me I was interested in either Rowing or Running so it made my decision easier. But even then, I was not too sure which one would prove to be more efficient for my specific goal of gaining mass and looking like your average Bruh. I decided to search for an article on CIHNAL. CIHNAL is a paramedical bank of information that comprises of articles written by nurses, nutrition, kinesiologist, and many more. The article I found was written by Edwards AM and Lander PJ in 2012 in the Journal of Sports Medicine issue 52 volume 4 pages 344-350.

                The article mentioned is useful because the information within it is transferrable. An article becomes transferrable when it is recent enough, contains population that resembles yours and finally it contains scientific and peer reviewed data. Usually, the threshold for up-to-date articles is around 10 years. Because the paper was written in 2012 it is up to date. The research was conducted in England subsequently the population of England is comparable to the population of Canada. Finally, the authors are both professionals in health and sports science. Patrick Edward Lander teaches at the Eastern Institute of Technology with his PHD in Exercise Physiology. On the other hand, Andrew Mathew Edwards is Researcher with a PHD at the Canterbury Christ Church University Un-Human and Life Sciences. I am very comfortable with Patrick Edwards specialty, but Andrew Edwards is a bit questionable but respectable to be honest.

                They wrote and article that compared the differences in VO2 max, Blood lactate concentration and Mean heart rate between running and rowing. To measure the differences, they asked 10 people around 24 years old to row and run 20 minutes with the same amount of effort. What they noticed was that Running had a greater impact on Cardiorespiratory system then rowing. Indeed, the mean heart rate for people who ran was 174+/- 5.9 b/min against 165+/- 6.6b/min for rowing. The same thing for VO2 Max with 86.1% vs 83.7%. Consequently, that would also mean that the lactate concentration was higher for the running portion with 4.0+/-0.8 mmol/L vs 3.3+/-1.2 mmol/L. So, what does all these numbers mean, it means that running is the slightly better than rowing.

                Now, should the results from this paper affect your selection of cardio routine. Honestly, no. The difference is minimal and what should be more important for you would be the group of muscles that you use. I have not done the research on that part yet and to be honest I will. I think that rowing uses more the upper body then running but for the moment its just a theory. Stay tuned for the next article that I decide to read, Godspeed.
