Part of the oncology unit is becoming a covid unit again because we have negative pressure rooms. I am seeing an annoying trend unfortunately. Most patients are unvaccinated and around their thirties. At least they are understanding and collaborating, so I don’t need to work with some anti-vaxxer attitude. I realized most of them are very attentive to what I have to say, mainly because I answer their question and explain how most patients with Covid are treated on our unit. Anyways, I am having fun but staying focused for school is harder than I thought because I must study even if I am feeling tired. </p>\r\n                    <h2>August 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>The infamous back to school season 😑. Honestly Its going well for the moment, I had time to check the school cursus and It is pretty good for my situation. A few team projects, a few exams solo and a lot of homework to do. The good thing is I can do everything at my leisure, the bad thing is if I fall behind, I am going to be in a really bad situation. I am continuing my job as a nursing intern in oncology by working 20h per 14days. </p>\r\n                    <h2>July 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    So, I don’t know how I feel about my unit lol. The team is cool, the patients are well taken of and mostly appropriate for our type of care and I genuinely like working at night. The tempo is a lot slower now since I know how the unit works. There is also the fact that I have the same 11 patients for 10 days straight. I make a work plan the first day and I can keep it for the next 11 days and tweak some stuff. If a patient gets discharged, I just add a new worksheet. I never thought I would be able to make a routine as a nurse, but I can. I try not to follow it, because some people require more care than others, but its so easy. I even decided to read a book atomic habits to learn how not to stick to my bad habits. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>June 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    First real month working as a nurse, and it’s been fun. Learning how a unit works, meeting new people and getting orientated on how to work as a team. I do not really have time to get back into my mountain biking habit since I don`t have a car anymore. Told myself I was going to transition to gravel biking to keep my fitness up, but I guess I will just hit up the pool instead since I love swimming. (FIY: I never did hit the pool during June. It was not out of laziness, but mostly because I couldn’t find a public pool that opened when I finished working)\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>May 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>I think this month was the month I went most fuck it in my life. I was tired physically and mentally and with my funds coming a bit short I kind of felt a bit stressed. Its not that I couldn`t pay my obligations like rent and etc…  There is also the fact that most of my money is in stocks right now sooo I am really trying not to withdraw my money just to feel better about my bank account number. It`s just annoying to have a sub 2K bank account when you dream about a 6K bike. On the upside I am finally starting at the hospital, and I am psyched to get started. I am just going to have to tell my parents about my college.</p>\r\n                    <h2>April 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>Honestly, I am just going to keep it short this time. I am tired of school all I want to do is just start my job at the hospital and chill. But I know deep inside of me that now is not the time to chill. I am still young, and I can still keep pushing. I settled on just doing enough to feel like I am still productive, but not enough to want to absolutely want to not give a god damn shit about life.  So yeah, I am having a lot of fun right now xD.</p>\r\n                    <h2>March 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>So, this month I had a bit of an unprecedented month. Starting to help out at the hospital again so I took 2 days of my job. School is doing okay, but I need to put in more effort, I let go for like one week and now I feel like I am absolutely lost.</p>\r\n                    <p>On the upside I finally started getting my bike parts for this season. Gonna go through with turning my bike into a mini-enduro rig. Got most of the parts that I need, now I`ll just play around with the stuff that I have. And keep ordering parts until July. Slowly but surely, I can build myself a cool rig. I plan on buying a gravel bike later too so that is going to be fun.</p>\r\n                    <p>Finally, I do regret spending less time talking with my family, but when I get my final dose for the vaccine I`ll start trying to talk with them a lot. </p>\r\n                    <h2>February 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>School was super easy this month. I cannot really put my finger on it, but I think universities made the curriculum easier to compensate because of reduced academic support. Last year, we could have gone to the library, used all the campus labs. This year all we can do is use our computers and the power of the internet. I was able to work a bit on my website and implement things like the automatic header close function and start adding new content. I got a 360 down on my snowboard, I WAS SUPER STOKED. I think I can start going for bigger stuff on my snowboard. Unfortunately, snow is starting to melt to I do not have a lot of time. </p>\r\n                    <h2>January 2021</h2>\r\n                    <p>Well, we survived a year lol. I took time to read my whole blog and I realized that last year I did more then I remember. I smile when I read this because I realized for how much people said 2020 was bad, I still had a lot of fun doing my thing and learning to do code, getting back in school and working on bikes. I have a job lined up in 3 months now at a hospital in a beautiful place. All I need to do now is endure 3 more months and I am going have the time of my life. Going to knock on some wood and get back to work.</p>\r\n                    <h2>December 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>So final month of the year, it has been a year since I started doing monthly blog. I am happy I stuck with this project. I saw how I was at the beginning of the year and how I am doing now. I can confidently say that I grew this year and learned a lot more then I though. As I reread this, I realize all the details that I missed in the month. I can also see that I sugar-coated a few stories in this page LMAO. I am still working on being transparent even with things that are hard to say. Even now it feels like I can be truthful to myself, but I can`t lie to my family. I still have a lot of things that I plan to do. For the moment, I am going to get back on coding and wait for my ER job to start in May. </p>\r\n                    <br/><b>Lesson of the Year</b>\r\n                    <p>I realized that I tend to underplay a lot off stuff. As I reread this blog of 2020 the small details that I thought didn`t matter seem to be more important now in the future. Guess that`s my lesson this year, pay attention to the small details.</p>\r\n                    <b>Resolutions</b>\r\n                    <p>More Biking, More Nursing, More volunteering, and more Coding. </p>\r\n                    <h2>November 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>November went by faster then I thought. I got around buying new snowboarding gear this month. I wasn’t ready for the expenses for my dads car though. I SPENT 1K on winter tires. On the upside, I did do research on them, and I know for a fact that they will last around 5-10 years easily. I started my interships at the hospital again. I am in geriatry in CHSLD chevalier de levi and I realized that there is a lot for me to relearn. Most notably is the approach with older people. I am someone who likes to move fast and taking my time feels really slow. In an older population going slower allows them to understand what you are doing and get more cooperation.</p>\r\n                    <h2>October 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>Its getting better. Had some pretty good exam in school so I am happy about that. Started calling and doing my registrations for my jobs. Got a callback from CHUQ in order to go work on the 31th of may 2021. Honestly I AM SOOO EXCITED FOR THIS. It would really be cool to visit a city and go work in Quebec next to SDM and Charlevoix. I do have to admit I am kinda scare about the last checks that I need to do like sending my Immatriculation. I Dunno, I feel like because I really want to get this job the pressure is up. </p>\r\n                    <h2>September 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>Honestly with school picking up and me getting less time at the job It feels like I am still working full time. The only difference is that I am studying a lot more at home. I do admit I am having a few troubles with this because I tend to be able to navigate towards youtube in one click. And pair that with half a year of studying online and using youtube vids to learn how to code react and you get a guy that instinctly goes towards youtube. But apart from that its going pretty good. My income with work is sufficient, nothing to be happy about but it lets me keep a bit of income in the side for stuff I want to buy like my bike next year. </p>\r\n                    <h2>August 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>Yo, august wen in a flash. I was happy with my work and getting into enduro racing. My placement on the ladder has improved, I am able to get top 5 in mens elite. But that’s still a far from men’s pro. I realized on multiple race day that I was riding with the wrong bike. YUP, I only have 120 mm of travel front and rear against people with 170mm with slacker headtubes. The result of that is that my bike is a lot more twitchier at high speeds then them. And because of that I might feel like I am less composed when I am going fast.School started again, Online for the most part with a few classes physical in order to review nursing techniques and approach. </p>\r\n                    <p>In the shop we had a problem with the port so we didn’t receive any shipment for like 3 weeks. We are out of bikes and so my job went from bike mechanic to warehouse employee I guess. Means I gotta work on receive, treating and classing packages in the meantime that we get bikes.</p>\r\n                    <h2>July 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>This month I had my first bike race in ever. I live in Montreal but I had to drive all the way to Herbert-Ville in order to race. I did what people call an enduro race. An Enduro MTB race is about 25-30km and I am only timed on my descent. Yup its more time trial then anything. That’s also one of the reason why I can race during the pandemic. We all go down the race courses one at a time. That means we respect the sanitary measuires that are forced by the government. How did I fare? Bad lmao. I finished 6/8 with a total time of 17minutes on 4 stages. My friend checked my time and told me I had the best times on the first 3 stages then I threw the towel on the 4 stages with a 6minute finish on that one only. I have a few excuses to justify my placement on the ladder. But I am over excuses this year, all I am gonna do is get better and work on my weaknesses like commiting to big jumps and also plowing through rock gardens. </p>\r\n                    <p>On the work side, its getting more complicated because we are opening more stores and our demand is starting to explode. We are also expanding our services so we have to learn how to take care of more stuff.</p>\r\n                    <p>Personal side, kinda complicated I want to tell my parents I am moving out, but I fear they might be super against the idea. Ill tell them soon. </p>\r\n                    <h2>June 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Second month as a bike Mechanic and I have the feeling that people are buying even more bikes. We went out of stock for awhile but then we got bikes again. I have the feeling that people ordered even more bikes this month.  On the good side I have been working so much I was able to save around 2k this month into my savings. On the bad side, I don’t have enough time to recheck my MCAT papers, nursing papers and programming lessons during the week. So, I slowed down academically a lot.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Got back into mountain biking seriously because I really want to get into racing until I turn 30 which means that I must start riding and training a lot. I am already planning to do swim/snowboarding during the winter in order to compensate or get myself a dirt jump and go indoor tricking.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    School finally told us which classes where online and honestly, I am pleasantly surprised because most of them are online. I don’t know how I will manage online classes so for the next month I will force myself to learn some stuff during the week to simulate workload.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>May 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    At the beginning of this month I got a call from Decathlon that was looking for a bike mechanic to help them do some E-commerce with their bikes. Right now, the weather is getting hotter and people are starting to avoid public transits. Public transits with the current pandemic represent a breeding ground for COVID and in response people have started using more their personal means of transportation. Because the median salary is around 40k in Montreal you can see why people are opting for bikes. Biking represents a personal means of transportation that is reliable (unlike the goddamn STM in Montreal), it represents a healthy way of getting your daily dose of fitness during the day and finally its affordable for most people. With bikes ranging from 500$ to 10 000$ you can choose how much you want to invest in a bike.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Because of the explosion of demand in bikes I started working and realized that we had to verify, assemble and repair around  350 bikes per week for the next month basically. I was happy to get back to work, but to say the truth it is a daunting number even for the team I work with. At least I get to have a secure income for summer.  Since I am working 40-48h a week now I feel exhausted when I want to review MCAT material for next semester or learn coding.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    I still want to learn how to use API, but I stumbled onto a small fear of mine. The gist of it is API keys are supposed to be personal because you can only use them around 10 times a minute. So, if you share it with somebody else well, you both can only use it 10 times a minute. I know how to do front end, so my API keys are going to be public. If someone uses mine without my approval well my website isn’t going to work. Some API charge you for every use and if someone steals it you can have a 6-digit receipt head your way very fast. In order to continue I need to see how to secure or encrypt my key to make sure my website works well.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Because I live alone now, I can’t really rely on someone else to make meals for me. I finally started using recipes and planning the budget I have in order to make sure I keep my spending in check. I want to save up a bit of money for my last semester so I can get through it without worrying about money. I do have to say with how cheap I am its looking like I can really save the amount I need ( 5k) easily.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>April 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Because of the current pandemic I got a side job at our local grocery store just to have an income.  This month I learned a lot about photography, editing, filmmaking and coding. The reason I pushed forward with coding is because I want to learn how to use the React framework. If React is good enough for Facebook, then it’s good enough for me. I learned about photography because I want to start recording and editing my rides for YouTube on the side and take pictures for my website. On the downside I couldn’t review  Math and physics because I didn’t push hard enough on that.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET BACK ON MY BIKE! After such a long hiatus it was fun to get back on my spark 950 and continue teaching myself some tricks like manuals, endos, 180 and fakie.\r\n                    I have yet to master those tricks but I plan to get them down this season.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Lesson of the Month: You can always find something to do.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>March 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    What a fun time to be alive. The highlight of this month was the coronavirus outbreak and the shift of tone in multiple countries regarding the severity of the disease. I was working until the 13 of March, then we got the announcement that work would be suspended until further notice. It’s the end of the month and we aren’t even sure if work is going to start again in April. In the meantime, I started biking, shifting my exercise to bodyweight exercise and staying home a lot more then I would want to. I am starting to get fluent in JS and I plan on learning the React.JS library so I can rework the appearance of my website and finally implement some JS. I have been playing more videogames, but I had fun creating Meme videos and pushing my editing skills forward. Most notably, my color grading skills and highlighting skills are getting way better. I can even switch colors in Adobe Photoshop.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Lesson of the Month: it’s hard to stay occupied home and it reminds me why I love working even if it is a 9 to 5. It gets me outside, and I can get out of my house.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>February 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    February was a bit dull for me. The only highlights that I had were the personal ones that I made for myself. I decided during this month that I was going to focus my training. Usually I bike and swim weekly, but with winter here I switch biking for the gym. When I swim, I try to hit around 20 laps in the 25-meter pool for a total of 1km ( 25m * 20 * 2 = 1000m). For some reason I wasn’t happy or exhausted with the process and the way I train. So, I decided to tailor my training around achieving 3 goals that allow me to build endurance and strength at the same time. Endurance wise I want to be able to achieve an ironman by the end of the year. That means that I should be able to bike 190km, swim 3.8km and run 42km. For strength my goal is to squat around 350lb or 158kg and bench around 250lb or 112kg. In order to achieve these goals, I had to rework my squatting technique because I wasn’t going low enough.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    On the study side, I got contacted by UdeS that confirmed to me that they would allow me to transfer for my next semester if I feel like it. I decided to send them my academic dossier to talk with them and see what cursus they would make me do to get my degree in nursing. I was able to finish the CARS section of the MCAT and add a few tools to my test taking skills. On the coding side I am stuck on JavaScript and having a bit of difficulties in learning how to implement scripts on my website. Once I do expect this site to completely change. I feel like remodeling this site anyways to make it more dynamic in the future and revisit each page to assure responsiveness ( it’s a lot of work that I am giving myself but its going to help me build skills).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    And that’s my February of 2020, dull but at least I got stuff to do to keep my brain going 😊.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    <b>Lesson of the month:</b> I realised that planning and information gathering is a a crucial part for setting big goals for your life. Planning is easy, but information gathering on subjects that you didn't know much about before is tedious and can feel long. But, i guess that’s the price to pay if you want to set goals that can allow you to move further in life.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>January 2020</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    To be honest my January of 2020 was bad. My nursing program is in an accelerated cursus. It’s a four-year program crammed into three years. They are aware of that and tell us students on the very first day how particular the nursing bachelor is compared to other programs. Because of that particularity, you cannot fail one class during a semester. If you fail one class, it puts you back a whole semester.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    So, I failed a semester and it prolonged my bachelor to three and half years. I am currently on probation until the next cycle comes back. Because I am not enrolled this semester, I have a lot more time to learn skills that I was going to learn post-degree. Skills like coding, content creation and team management where things that I was interested in learning after my bachelors. But I decided to take on coding and review basic contents of biology and biochemistry to keep myself busy.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    My goal for January was to publish this website online and have fun learning how to code. I had my own personal deadline but having someone like him and my dad put a bit more pressure on me is forcing me to concentrate more. Honestly, it’s helping me focus a bit because I know I have a duty to myself and to them to respect my deadline.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    <b>Lesson of the month:</b> I currently find that the amount of pressure that I put on myself changes whether I do something for somebody or for myself. When I do something for myself, I know its not important because I am nonchalant guy. I owe to myself only what I want and to be honest I don’t want a lot. I think I am apathic and that for some reason I tend to ride with the waves, even if the waves are pushing me back to sea. When I do something for somebody else, I tend to put more effort. I want to give something perfect to them, so they are impressed or not able to formulate criticism. I like that I put a lot of effort when I do something for somebody, but I should also put all that effort when I do something for myself. Then, I think about all the work that it is going to take, and I start to procrastinate. I let work pile and I tend to mask myself with pointless pleasures like videogames and listening to music until I must do what is essential. Unfortunately, that work pattern never leaves me satisfied with my work, it just leaves me resentful of the task that I must do.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </article>\r\n            </div>    \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Blog\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport \"./Blog.css\";\r\n\r\nfunction BlogYear() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"blog\">\r\n            <article className=\"blog__year\">\r\n                <h2>2020</h2>\r\n                <p><b>So How was 2020 for Me?</b></p>\r\n                <p>I am not gonna lie, 2020 Was a hell of a year</p>\r\n                <p><b>Let's start with the good.</b></p>\r\n                <p> 2020 represented a year where I could bounce back from my worst defeat yet and focus on what I really like. I got into Mountain biking, fitness, coding and nursing (again). When I say I really got into mountain biking; What I mean is I started racing, looking at details like geometry and specs on a bike to have an idea of the feel. Racing was a cool experience even though I did finish last on 2 races, but 4th Overall. Fitness kinda came with mountain biking. I went to the gym to push my body so I could pedal harder out of turns. Coding was a first for me but here we are xD. I am making my own website, publishing my projects and ideas on my own platform and contributing to open GitHubs. Nursing, Last year I failed hard, Never even had the guts to tell to my parents. But here I am not giving up and going at it again. The reason why is because in my mind I can only lose if I give up. Fortunately for me, my dad didn't raise a quitter. So here I am back again, getting up and getting ready to give everything I like another shot.</p>\r\n                <p><b>The bad.</b></p>\r\n                <p>This year I HAD SO MUCH ANXIETY. The problem with me is that I don't want to externalise my problems because to an extent my family relates with me and usually suffers with me. I am stoic because at the end it causes my familly less pain and in turn less for me. I kinda forced myself to move out and I am discovering really for the first time why making a certain amount of money is important. I am contempt with my lliving situation but I know for a fact if I did an extra month with strangers as roomates, I would lose my shit. Don't get me wrong the guys are really cool, but they are idiots who don't understand the concept of maintenance and moderation. To be fair I didn't before but I am slowly growing up, and I want all this pain to be a catalyst for my adulthood.</p>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BlogYear\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport \"./Item.css\";\r\n\r\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Item({title,backgroundImg,desc,descLink,summary,pair,link}) {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"item\" style={{\r\n            backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImg})`\r\n        }}>\r\n            <div className=\"item__container\">\r\n                <div className=\"item__text\">\r\n                    <p className=\"item__title\">{title}</p>\r\n                    <div className=\"item__textDesc\">\r\n                    <p>{desc}</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    {summary && <div className={ pair? \"item__summary2\": \"item__summary\"}>\r\n                    {summary}\r\n                    </div>}\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"item__lowerThird\">\r\n                    <Link to={link}>{descLink}</Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Item\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Pic1.5b7107a4.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/JUMPE.5e72c3a8.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Swaggles.284a9ce1.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\r\nimport \"./Card.css\";\r\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Card({image, description, link, title}) {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n\t\t\t<h2>{title}</h2>\r\n\t\t    <div className=\"box\">\r\n\t\t\t    <div className=\"imgBx\">\r\n\t\t\t\t    <img src={image}/>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t    <p>{description}</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t    <Link to={link}>Read More</Link>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Card\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/20200721_091449.20dd1b1b.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport Item from \"../Components/Item/Item\";\r\nimport Opening from \"../Ressource/Pic1.jpg\";\r\nimport Jump from \"../Ressource/JUMPE.jpg\";\r\nimport Swaggles from \"../Ressource/Swaggles.jpg\";\r\nimport Card from \"../Components/Card/Card\";\r\nimport \"./Welcome.css\";\r\nimport Trail1 from \"./Travel/ToDo/Oka/Oka_Ressource/20200721_091449.jpg\"\r\n\r\n//So this is the page I used as a template. and I will talk about the cards and the items.\r\n// Items allow me to do that first part of the page that appears and indicate the the title and subject of the page.

I did it because I was kinda sick of having to always tell people who want to buy me gift what to get me. So I just did a website. But, you can do this to return a list of items for a shop or use them as cards for a new section.</p>\r\n                        <h2>How did you program this</h2>\r\n                        <p>Well I had a hard time programming it in the beginning because I am not fluent in React. I am also pretty sure that what I did was not the best approach as well. What I did was put in a state that is dependent of my value imput. After the state is chosen It parses every card and either shows them or not if the value above corresponds with the state. For exemple if you press MTB you will only get MTB items. I had to implement another state to allow people to see all of the items together. That part kinda took awhile because I had to put a || (Or statement) with 2 IF statement. But again I just learnt about ES6 so I had to tinker with it a bit to get it to work <i>(Don't get me started with ES7).</i> I will have a link of the code to my GitHub and you can check it out. Feel free to take my Subgift component if you want to use it for your projects. This project is just for fun and if people use parts of it for theirs I am just going to be happy.</p>\r\n                        <h2>Deep Dive</h2>\r\n                        <p>Now that I put my gift list online and have it on my github account I can talk about it more in depth.</p>\r\n                        <p>If you look at the file you'll realise that the giftlist is 3 parts. The Header, The gift area and finally the cards containing the gifts. Now the 2 latter are easy to program because they dont really need logic. Its more HTML. The gifts are the one who need to be well programed. I kinda have to give them a meaning so that my categories in the gift area can parse their value and return the appropriate gifts.</p>\r\n                        <p>Now I have one bug/Side effect. If you keep the category at all it displays all the items with even space in between them. Now change it to MTB or Fashion. The items are spaced unevenly. The reason this happens is because all of the items become divs. For some unknown reason divs take 0px but when stacked together they take a bit of space and make the spacing between each item uneven. How am I going to fix that, I dunno LMAO</p>\r\n                    </article>\r\n                </Route>\r\n            </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CodingProject\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport \"../Review.css\"\r\n\r\nfunction HighTower2019() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <article className=\"review__article\">\r\n            <h1>All Mountain Bike?</h1>\r\n            <h3>The one quiver bike?</h3>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Presentation\">Presentation</h3>\r\n            <p>The 2019 HighTower from Santa Cruz is an all mountain bike. Supported with 140mm of rear travel and 150mm of front travel the bikes objectifs is to be ridden anywhere. Soft packed trails, Check; Hard rowdy trails, Check. The HighTower Boast 67° HTA, 435mm chainstay and a seat tube of 74.3°. These numbers are reasonable and should allow you to ride the bike park and the sketchy trails in your neighborhood</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Spec\">Specs</h3>\r\n            <p>its been to long lmao</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Climbing\">Climbing</h3>\r\n            <p>So, I am pretty sure you are asking yourself how a Santa Cruz Hightower with 150mm front travel and 140mm of rear travel climbs. To be honest, a lot better than I expected. The front of the fork has a lockout for when you must climb all the way up the mountain. The position and linkage of the rear shock restrict the amount of pedal bob that you must endure to get up the mountain. Like really, The VPP suspension design link allows the bike to be very progressive and keep you at a sweet spot of that curve. When you are going up you do not really apply a lot of pressure, so the rear shock only needs to adjust to small bumps, and it does that job well. </p>\r\n            <p>Handling wise, the Hightower is a bike that felt a bit sluggish going up. The front of the bike was always planted on the ground even when tackling 30degree hills. My only problem during that type of climb was wrestling the front of my bike to turn and keep enough momentum to not have to dismount. But again, I barely execute that climb with my own XC/Trail bike so just barely making it with a full-on trail/enduro bike is an accomplishment. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Descending\">Descending</h3>\r\n            <p>This section right here, is where I can start praising the bike. I have ridden a few bikes. I am starting to understand how the specs change the feel of a bike. The tricky thing about making a bike that can climb and descend is making sure that the handling is not in the extremes of sluggish or twitchy and that the bike does not feel too plush or too responsive. In my opinion, the bike feels very well. When you go fast, you start noticing small bumps less and only really noticing those big hits. For example, I would not feel the braking bumps on a berm, but I would more then likely feel a hell of compression when I tried a 6 feet drop. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Overall\">Overall</h3>\r\n            <p>Overall I was pretty satisfied with my demo of the bike. To be honest I would have really prefered a steeper seat tube angle. I dont think you can add a long er fork but maybe reducing the travel and slackening with head tube slacker would make wonders for this bike. But again I like too feel in the middle of my bike because I usually ride a spark 950.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Strengths\">Pro's and Con's</h3>\r\n            <div className=\"review__proscons\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h4>Con's</h4>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>HTA not slack enough</li>\r\n                        <li>A bit sluggish on climbs</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h4>Pro's</h4>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>One Quiver Bike</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </article>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HighTower2019\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Spark2018() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n        <article className=\"review__article\">\r\n            <h1>XC Perfomance and Trail Comfort</h1>\r\n            <h3>Descend fast and Climb faster?</h3>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Presentation\">Presentation</h3>\r\n            <p>The 2018 Scott Spark is a trail/XC bike that is intended for people who love climbing more than descending. That does not mean that the bike is a slow descender in its category.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Spec\">Specs</h3>\r\n            <p>I have the 950 Scott Spark. Its the cheapest of the bung at 2600CAD. Its outfitted with a 32 fox, Deore drivetrain and syncros externals.  I think for the price its really well kited, but I think that the stem is a bit too long for me. I really like descending, so a shorter stem allowed me to be able to get more behind my bike and not suffer from the old OTB treatment. As per Scott bikes, This bicycle is outfitted with a synchro’s lock-out on the handlebar that allows it to lock out the fork and the shock to reduce pedal bob and augment pedal efficiency. I tried the system a few times and realized that If you want it to keep working properly you have to check it every month of riding. One crash is enough to move the lockout spring in the fork and make the system ineffective. On top of that I am really a fan of simple cables, simple cockpit. The lockout adds a lot to the already jammed cockpit. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Climbing\">Climbing</h3>\r\n            <p>I do not like lying so I will be honest. This bike climbs really well even after switching the stem. Before switching the stem I didn’t really have to lean forward for those really steep climbs. I don have to admit that techy climbs on rocks were a bit hard with the stem at 55m. Now with the shorter stem, I have to lean forward for those really steep climbs but I don`t mind. The stock tires are pretty good and light, but I do have to admit that you can change them for more aggressive tires. When you really need to put the power down they slip until you adjust your body position. The tires work, but I think they if you want to change something first change the tires for a more aggressive pattern.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Descending\">Descending</h3>\r\n            <p>I got a few problems with how this bike came stock for descents. You can descend with this bike, but its never going to be a priority until you change a few specs in this bike. The longer stem makes this bike feel slightly twitchy when you go super fast. Only problem is, you accelerate super fast with this bike which is why it was a bit uncomfortable. Its snappy so you can always just jump everything and surprisingly land well. The bike has a good suspension platform. I put a bit more PSI because I love jumping and just going Barreli gas when I can. For a 120mm rear suspension, this bike can handle more then your average XC bike can. Hell man If It was on me I’d call it down country but, the rest of the package seems to hold it back. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Overall\">Overall</h3>\r\n            <p>Overall the scott Spark is a really good bike for people who only do XC and what a bit more plush from their XC bikes. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <h3 id=\"Strengths\">Pro's and Con's</h3>\r\n            <div className=\"review__proscons\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h4>Con's</h4>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>HTA not slack enough</li>\r\n                        <li>Twitchy on the descents</li>\r\n                        <li>Specced only for XC</li>\r\n                        <li>TwinLoc technology not efficient</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h4>Pro's</h4>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>CLimbs faster then a Tesla rocket</li>\r\n                        <li>Good Bike to start on</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Spark2018\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Card from '../../../../Components/Card/Card';\r\n\r\nfunction Altitude2021() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <article className=\"review__article\">\r\n                <h1>EWS contender</h1>\r\n                <h3>What does it take to win the EWS</h3>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Presentation\">Presentation</h3>\r\n                <p>The 2021 Altitude from Rocky Mountain is their EWS winning bike under Jesse Melamed. It is built for going up efficiently and descending as fast as possible just like in enduro races. The bike received a new rehaul this year, that has people like me excited. I got a chance to rent the bike for about 3 hours and do a first ride impression on the bike. </p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Spec\">Specs</h3>\r\n                <p>The model I got to test out was the A50 which is an aluminium bike with an in the middle specs. It had fox 36, SLX and XT Deore drivetrain and brakes with an aluminum wheelset. The bike boasts 170mm of travel upfront and 160mm of travel in the rear. The reach on the L bike was a bit short for me at 474mm. It took me around 30 min of the 3h that I had to get used to the reach.  The wheelbase is rather long at 1249mm but pretty in spot for enduro bikes. The handlebar was a tad bit too small for me at 780mm but just like the rest you can get used to it. Finally, the tires on the bike had assegais 2.5 in front and DHR 2.4 in the back. </p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Climbing\">Climbing</h3>\r\n                <p>Let’s be honest, this isn`t the section that you want to read or hear about. BUT, if you do, then the bike is okay at climbing. If you are going through a gravel road or a fire road climb you can lock the suspension and the bike doesn’t move an inch. If you are going up a trail climb you can put the shock in firm mode and climb like as if it was a 100-120mm bike. It is reassuring that you can use the pedal assist switch to turn your bike from an energy sapping machine to an efficient climber. When you pair that with a comfortable position and a 12 speed SLX drivetrain, you get a bike that you can take your time going up the hill and reserving your energy for those sweet, sweet descents. The only complain I did have was with my front wheel wandering from time to time when I was not paying too much attention or when I was tired. You do need to take this bike seriously when you’re going up or down or you might slip up. The tires are really well specked. On the climbs, I never spun out even on the steepest climbs. There is this famous climb at my mountain that comes straight after a corner. You don’t really have time gain speed in a run-up. With the 12 speed, the comfortable position and the tires, I had just enough to make the climb.</p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Descending\">Descending</h3>\r\n                <p>This is the section you want to read. When you point the bike downhill, put your suspension on open you can go down as fast as you want. Just like any bike the smoothest line is usually the fastest line. The pro with the altitude is that sometimes your smoothest line is going to be going Mach speed on a gnarly line.  Between going around a boulder and taking your chances at jumping over it and landing flat the latter is going to be the best option with the altitude. The suspension absorbs what it has to and doesn’t what it doesn’t need to. That unfortunately doesn’t mean you can get away with landing flat on the ground (FIY: you’ll still feel that pain in your heels as you land). The bike corners pretty well to be honest and is easy to lay down for those flat corners. The bike does require you to be active and it is expected from a long travel the bike. On slacker terrain the bike numbs terrain and the only way to make it feel livelier is to firm up your suspension. That being said if running the bike on firm mode makes it better for you can still get the bike run in on firm on normal days and set it open for those rough enduro or bike park days. </p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Overall\">Overall</h3>\r\n                <p>This is the bike that I want, but unfortunately not the bike that I need. Its too much suspension for all the things that I do, and it has allowed me to appreciate being under biked to be honest. If I had it in the garage, I would bring it out one ride out of two just to have the fun of plowing through everything and not really care about line decision. The trails here in Quebec are on the softer side which is why I am saying this.</p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h3 id=\"Strengths\">Pro's and Con's</h3>\r\n                <div className=\"review__proscons\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h4>Con's</h4>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Front wheel wanders when climbing if you don't pay attention</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h4>Pro's</h4>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Fun bike</li>\r\n                            <li>pedals efficiently with the assist (talking about the assist, you can get to it easily)</li>\r\n                            <li>suspension is reactive enough to feel the trail and smooth it out</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </article>\r\n            <div className=\"review\">\r\n                <h2>Recommended</h2>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"review__card__space\">\r\n                <Card link=\"/BikeReviews/Hightower2019\" image=\"https://p.vitalmtb.com/photos/products/23470/photos/36439/s1600_Hightower_Carbon_C_S_Mustard_and_Slate_Blue.jpg?1531954283\" title=\"HighTower 2019\" description=\"Review of the HighTower.

I met the guy with a laidback attitude, and he told me he has a lot of experience training with teams and athletes. Usually he trains football college athletes, so being a mountain biker and a swimmer kind of throws him a softball. But he told me he was going to do a bit of research and work out something for me. I told him my frequency of sports, my average wattage when I ride and that I wanted to improve my wattage. He took all that information into aspect and told me to give him 2 days to get something ready.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Fast forward 2 days I meet up with him and he explains his plan to me. So, the basis of my training regimen in the gym is to go for an initial effort of about 80% and sustain it with a superset to workout my endurance. It simulates the amount of effort that I put in when I start going up the mountain because, I will always have resistance when I am pedaling up the mountain.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    First week up I have 2 supersets with one being a double set and another one being a triple set. The first exercise has resistance exercise with a front lunge or back lunge with a squat bar followed by bodyweight exercise that use my core and legs. From my perspective It looks legit, and I can very well relate to the initial push followed by keeping the rhythm. It applies very well to my downhill sections of enduro where you need to start with an aggressive acceleration and keep the rhythm until the end of the section.  His part is done now I need to do mine which is consistency and making sure I have fun during the whole training regimen.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    This is it for the first week, come back next month to see how I feel about it and how its going to go. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Now that I started really getting into the tempo I understand more the exercises that he gave me. Its kinda a full body work out but with a major emphasis on my legs. I usaully fail the sets when I add weight to my lunges with the squat bar. I am happy I can put weight, But I miss my deadlifts. I realized I am a deadlift bro.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Training2021\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Item from \"../../../Components/Item/Item\";\r\nimport { Switch, Link, Route} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Training2021 from './Training/Training2021';\r\n\r\nfunction Races() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Item backgroundImg=\"https://www.elasticinterface.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/enduro-Mtb-10-consigli-5-1.jpg\" title=\"Time To Go fast\"/>\r\n            <Switch>\r\n                <Route exact path='/BikeRaces'>\r\n                    <article>\r\n                        <h2>New Races</h2>\r\n                        <p>My local race series is the <a href=\"https://www.wildsideenduro.com/\">Wildside enduro</a>.

It's been awhile but I still think I can offer a few tips.</p>\r\n                        <p>Tips for racing:</p>\r\n                        <b>#1 Pre-day track recon</b>\r\n                        <p>Most enduro races have a pre-race recon thats usually done 1-2 days before the race. Honestly this might be the most important thing to do. I Highly suggest you check out the tracks and search for the race lines that are faster.</p>\r\n                        <b>#2 Check your gear</b>\r\n                        <p>Depending on race condition you are going to want to change your setup. On rainier days you should decrease Psi in your tires and your shock as well as reduce rebound a bit to compensate. Always experiment with your setup before race day to dial your setting. If you don't its ok. But, the important aspect is feeling comfortable on your bike and making sure you can always maneuver without feeling awkward on your bike</p>\r\n                        <b>#3 Its okay to be anxious</b>\r\n                        <p>Especially if it's your first race you might not finish top 3 even in amateur. So don't sweat it. You gotta start somewhere and start with getting experience in the whole race setting. Your goal is to get better and being timed against better people and just hanging out with them is gonna push you to do your best.

You are going to need a few things to be honest:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>1-Computer</li>\r\n                    <li>2-Code editing software (Visual Studio)</li>\r\n                    <li>3-Books or a Source of information to learn coding from (youtube,  Codeacademy or College course).</li>\r\n                    <li>4-Patience.</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    First Up you are going to need access to a computer. Some types of coding need compiling and interpreting, but for website creation that is not the case. That means that we do not need a super expensive computer. Honestly, your school computer or a 600$ USD laptop is going be more then enough for getting into HTML, CSS, and JS.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Second Up, we are going to choose our editing software. I recommend Visual Studio because I learned how to code with it, so I am biased. You can learn how to code with another software. The only thing I recommend is researching how easy a coding editor is to use and how popular the coding software is. If you realize that there are few guides for your editing software, then it might not be the best idea to use that code editor. After downloading a coding software, you need to make a folder where your projects are going to be saved.  Single documents do not need planning but when you start making multiple folders and files for a document you must follow a tree like organisation where your main file is the root and it expand towards precise section called branches:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img src={Picture}/>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Thirdly, you need to create your own library of information. You can use books, videos, and websites to create a reliable source of information. A lot of web developers do tutorials on YouTube that you can follow along to learn specific things like side bars, page transition and another variable.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Lastly, reading all of this and integrating the information is going to take a lot of time. All you need to do is be consistent and have patience.  \r\n                </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Prerequisite\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { HashRouter, Switch, Link, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport Prerequisite from './Prerequisite/Prerequisite';\r\n\r\nimport Item from \"../../../Components/Item/Item\";\r\nimport Card from \"../../../Components/Card/Card\";\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Coding101() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n        <Item backgroundImg=\"https://i.cbc.ca/1.3241386.1443093888!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/classroom.jpg\" title=\"How to get into Coding\" desc=\"Coding is really easy, All you need to do is give it a shot\"/>\r\n        <Switch>\r\n            <Route exact path='/CodingTut'>\r\n                <article>\r\n                    <h2>Welcome to Coding 101</h2>\r\n                    <p>In this section we are gonna talk about how I got into coding and everything I learned so you can learn as well</p>\r\n                    <p>I am not a professional by say, but I can help guide you on what to learn in order have a solid base and get better at coding.</p>\r\n                    <p>Below you are going to find 4 cards that you can use to learn or doublecheck your coding skills.

Oka was built by a community of volunteer in the past and the people who rode in Oka where the ones who knew about it through word of mouth or the local riders that built these trails. Throughout the years more people volunteered to help build the trails and add features that they wanted to ride like jumps, rock rollers and gaps. The trail center kept growing and attracted a lot of people for the small city of Oka which was already renowned for its cheese.</p>\r\n                <p>Now with the implementation of a pay to ride system the abbey of Oka is going to use its revenue to grow the trails, help the city, its citizens and allow riders to get more variety. I spoke with a few of the people who work there, and they were telling me that the trails of Oka have started to get a lot more love since they started charging 10$ to access the trails. Parking is free in front of the abbey, but it might change to a pay to park system.</p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <div className=\"article__picture\">\r\n                    <img src={Trail1} alt=\"Begining of a trail\"/>\r\n                    <h6>Gnarly first berm</h6>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <p>I went there on a weekend with an acquaintance who wanted to get back into mountain biking and the amount of people that come now is astonishing. Its really cool to see the trail center go from illegal trails, volunteer work, and finally pride of the city. The people that came were people who wanted to go for a chill ride, parents that were teaching their kids the sport of mountain biking and even us, people who want to go on certain trails to see if they can either put a new record on the local trails for airtime, or for Strava. </p>\r\n                <div className=\"article__picture\">\r\n                    <img src={Trail3} alt=\"A lot of wooden bridges\"/>\r\n                    <h6>Who doesn't love a skiny? The answer is me</h6>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <p>Some of the updates I instantly noticed was the reshaping of the flow track at the top. The flow track is a spot that allows people to see how well they can chain rollers and jumps. The track consisted of a few rollers and maybe 3 small jumps. Now, they added a gigantic berm after the bridge into a M-L tabletop. Now it is a question of how well you can chain obstacles and create speed to gap a 3-meter bridge into a very lippy jump. To be honest, I really like the changes that they added because it becomes a beginner friendly track that can allow an expert too open new line.  </p>\r\n                <p>Another Update they are going for is the addition of a bigger dirt jumps. I arrived during the remodeling of the jumps unfortunately. I cannot say now whether they are going to be big or not, but I have a good feeling about it. Apart from those changes to the Oka trail center most trails are the same but with well maintained berms of jumps. If you live in QC or near the RMM I think that checking out Oka would be a fun idea. </p>\r\n                <div className=\"article__picture\">\r\n                    <img src={Trail2} alt=\"Pump into a 4 feet jump\"/>\r\n                    <h6>More jumps fore more air time</h6>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MTBOka\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport Item from '../../../Components/Item/Item';\r\nimport MTBOka from \"./Oka/MTBOka\";\r\nimport Card from \"../../../Components/Card/Card\";\r\nimport Trail1 from \"./Oka/Oka_Ressource/20200721_091449.jpg\"\r\n\r\nfunction ToDo() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"todo\">\r\n            <Switch>\r\n                <Route exact path=\"/TravelTrips\">\r\n                    <Item backgroundImg=\"https://blog.klaxoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/template-vignette-TO-DO-LIST-1200x900.png\" />\r\n                        <h2 className=\"meh\">New Stuff</h2>\r\n                        <div className=\"new\">\r\n                            <Card image={Trail1} description=\"If you got time to bike In Oka Click Here\" link=\"/TravelTrips/Oka\" title=\"Biking In Oka\"/>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                </Route>\r\n\r\n                <Route path=\"/TravelTrips/Oka\"><MTBOka /></Route>\r\n            </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ToDo\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction RunningRowing() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <article>\r\n                <p>\r\n                I made plans to go the gym with a friend of mine then suddenly he told me he was going to be 15 minutes late. I decided I was going to do some cardio for the 15 minutes before bulking out on lifts as a mean to prepare myself for my training routine. So, here I am in the cardio spot of my Gym with the choice of either running, rowing or indoor biking. Then my question arose, which one is the best for me?    \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Luckily for me I was interested in either Rowing or Running so it made my decision easier. But even then, I was not too sure which one would prove to be more efficient for my specific goal of gaining mass and looking like your average Bruh. I decided to search for an article on CIHNAL. CIHNAL is a paramedical bank of information that comprises of articles written by nurses, nutrition, kinesiologist, and many more. The article I found was written by Edwards AM and Lander PJ in 2012 in the Journal of Sports Medicine issue 52 volume 4 pages 344-350.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The article mentioned is useful because the information within it is transferrable. An article becomes transferrable when it is recent enough, contains population that resembles yours and finally it contains scientific and peer reviewed data. Usually, the threshold for up-to-date articles is around 10 years. Because the paper was written in 2012 it is up to date. The research was conducted in England subsequently the population of England is comparable to the population of Canada. Finally, the authors are both professionals in health and sports science. Patrick Edward Lander teaches at the Eastern Institute of Technology with his PHD in Exercise Physiology. On the other hand, Andrew Mathew Edwards is Researcher with a PHD at the Canterbury Christ Church University Un-Human and Life Sciences. I am very comfortable with Patrick Edwards specialty, but Andrew Edwards is a bit questionable but respectable to be honest. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                They wrote and article that compared the differences in VO2 max, Blood lactate concentration and Mean heart rate between running and rowing. To measure the differences, they asked 10 people around 24 years old to row and run 20 minutes with the same amount of effort. What they noticed was that Running had a greater impact on Cardiorespiratory system then rowing. Indeed, the mean heart rate for people who ran was 174+/- 5.9 b/min against 165+/- 6.6b/min for rowing. The same thing for VO2 Max with 86.1% vs 83.7%. Consequently, that would also mean that the lactate concentration was higher for the running portion with 4.0+/-0.8 mmol/L vs 3.3+/-1.2 mmol/L. So, what does all these numbers mean, it means that running is the slightly better than rowing.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Now, should the results from this paper affect your selection of cardio routine. Honestly, no. The difference is minimal and what should be more important for you would be the group of muscles that you use. I have not done the research on that part yet and to be honest I will. I think that rowing uses more the upper body then running but for the moment its just a theory. Stay tuned for the next article that I decide to read, Godspeed.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Mickael Thébaud. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default RunningRowing\r\n","import { Language } from '@material-ui/icons'\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction RunningRowingFR() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <article>\r\n                <p>\r\n                J’ai décidé d’aller à la salle de musculation avec un ami. À la suite, il m’a annoncé qu’il serait en retard de 15 minutes.  Avec 15 minutes de plus, j’ai décidé de faire un peu de cardio avant de faire de la musculation. Donc, me voici dans la salle de sport avec le choix d’utiliser le rameur, le vélo immobile ou la machine à course. C’est à ce moment que je me suis demandé la question du titre, Qu’est qui est mieux entre la course à pied, pédaler et ramer.    \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Par chance pour moi, le rameur ou la course à pied était mes choix parce que je fais déjà trop souvent du vélo.  Mais, même avec mon nombre de choix réduit à 2 j’étais toujours indécis. Mon but dans la salle de musculation est de gagner plus de masse musculaire donc, j’ai cherché un article sur CIHNAL. CIHNAL est un moteur de recherche en ligne pour des articles qui sont écrit par des infirmiers, nutritionnistes, kinésiologie et autres professionnels de la santé. L’article que j’ai trouvé est un article rédigé par Edwards AM et Lander PJ en 2021 dans le journal de la médicine du sport, issue 52, volume 4 pages 344-350.                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                L’article décrit au-dessus est utile parce que sa contient de l’information qui est transférable et applicable à ma question. On parle de transférabilité lorsqu’un article est assez récent, lorsque la population étudier ressemble au votre et aussi lorsque l’information est validée par un autre rechercher. L’échéance pour un article à jour est souvent 10-15 ans. Parce que l’article a été rédigé en 2012 sa passe de justesse. La recherche a été faite avec une population anglaise qui est comparable à une population nord-américaine. Finalement les auteurs sont des professionnels de la santé et des sciences sportives. Patrick Edward Lander enseigne dans l’institut est de la technologie avec une maitrise en exercice alors que Andrew Mathew Edwards est un chercheur à l’université de Canterbury dans les sciences de la vie.                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Dans leurs articles, les auteurs comparent la différence en VO2max, lactate sanguin et la moyenne du débit cardiaque entre les personnes qui rament et qui courent. Afin d’avoir ces résultats, ils ont demandé une dizaine de personnes aux alentours de 24 ans de courir et ramer pendant 20 minutes avec la même quantité d’effort.  Après la collecte de données ils se sont aperçus que courir avait un plus grand impact cardiorespiratoire que ramer. La moyenne cardiaque pour les personnes qui courraient était 174+/-5.9 battement/min contre 165+/-6.6 battements/minutes. La VO2max témoignait les mêmes résultats avec une VO2max de 86.1% contre 83.7% utilisé pendant l’effort physique. Finalement la concentration en lactate sanguin à influencer de la même manière. La concentration post-exercice étaient 4.0+/-0.8mmol/L contre 3.3+/-1.2mmol/L. Donc, qu’est ce que cela veut dire pour nous? Cela veut juste dire que courir à un meilleur impact cardiorespiratoire que ramer.                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Maintenant est-ce que ces résultats devraient influencer votre choix d’activité cardio pré-musculation. Non, pas vraiment. Si vous voulez plus poussez vos poumons et votre cœur dans les 20 minutes de cardio vous pouvez courir parce que la différence n’est pas négligeable. Mais si votre but est comme moi de plus travailler les muscles alors la question se complexifie plus. Dans mon avis, ramer à un plus grand impact sur les muscles supérieurs que courir, mais c’est juste un avis.
